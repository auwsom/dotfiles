## CRONIC ERROR CHECKING PROCEDURE
Date: 2025-12-15

### How to Check for Cronic Errors from Overnight Backups:

#### Method 1: Check Mail Spool
```bash
# Check if user has mail
ls -la /var/mail/

# Check mailbox for cron errors
mail -u user -H 2>/dev/null | grep -A 10 -B 2 "Cron.*error\|ERROR\|Failed\|failed"

# Or check mail spool directly
sudo tail -50 /var/mail/user | grep -E "(ERROR|error|Failed|failed|cronic)"
```

#### Method 2: Filter by Date
```bash
# Check recent entries for today
sudo tail -100 /var/mail/user | grep -E "$(date +%b\ %d)"

# Look for error patterns
sudo tail -200 /var/mail/user | grep -E "(failed|Failed|ERROR|error|permission|denied)"
```

#### Method 3: Context Around Failed Actions
```bash
# Get context around failed actions
sudo grep -B 5 -A 5 "Action: failed" /var/mail/user

# Check for backup-specific failures
sudo grep -C 10 "virtnbdbackup\|backup" /var/mail/user | grep -E "(failed|Failed|ERROR|error)"
```

#### Common Error Types Found:
- ❌ Gmail delivery failures (not backup failures)
- ❌ Daily sending limit exceeded for email notifications
- ❌ SMTP delivery issues to external mail services
- ✅ Backup script execution errors (actual failures to investigate)

#### Key Findings:
- Most "Action: failed" messages are email delivery issues
- Backup failures will show script execution errors
- Check for "virtnbdbackup" or "backup" keywords in error context
- Gmail limits often cause false positives in cron error reporting
